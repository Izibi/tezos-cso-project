                    The purpose of this project is to showcase an implementation of a full platform which interacts with the Tezos blockchain. 
                    Additionally, it illustrates how challenges, which arise when moving from a simple local proof-of-concept implementation to a public online platform, can be addressed.

                    Due to the educational aim of this platform, some steps that go beyond the scope of a blockchain and would add complexity have been omitted 
                    (e.g. a full KYC process and CDD checks), while some features have been added to specifically demonstrate their implementation.

                    TZMINT is a sample application demonstrating a continuous agreement for future equity for Programmable Equity (PEQ) funding on Tezos. The token investors can buy and sell on this sample application is called <span className="font-semibold">TZM</span>.

                    The programmable equity offering is issued as a <span className="font-semibold">continuous agreement for future equity</span>, i.e. a continuous token offering of a programmable equity. <br/>
                    Companies set a minimal funding goal, deploy a smart contract that issues the tokens and handles funds, buy and sell transactions, and manages the reserve holding a certain percentage of the funding for buybacks. <br/>
                    Investors can buy and sell tokens at any point in time - as long as the offering is active. The price of the token is automated, initially set at a constant level and later adjusted by a buy and sell slope based on the 
                    number of tokens issued (i.e. acquired). The token is backed by the amount initially allocated to the reserve and the companyâ€™s future revenue.
